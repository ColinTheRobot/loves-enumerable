Old friend come back home
Even though you always were alone
You had to push against the fates
Just to make it
Make it through the gate

But now we're getting older
And we're growing up
So now less action in the water
And we know enough
Stood up on the rooftop on a night so clear
That the lights from the city just disappeared

I know you
Don't believe me
When I believe in you
I know it could get much easier
If you want it to

Old friend come to me
Everything I was, I used to be
I went north and I went east
Following the footsteps of
Some beautiful beast

But now we're getting older
And we're growing up
So now less action in the water
And we know enough
Stood up on the rooftop on a night so clear
That the lights from the city just disappeared

I know you
Don't believe me
When I believe in you
I know it could get much easier
If you want it to

I know you
Don't believe me
When I believe in you
I know it could get much easier
If you want it to

Oh, how we used to run up in the park
Cool air, and eucalyptus leaves
Oh, how we'd look out
Out over the bay
Must've fallow through the gate
Couldn't wait to get away

I know you
Don't believe me
When I believe in you
I know it could get much easier
If you want it to

I know you
Don't believe me
When I believe in you
But I know it's getting easier
Like it's supposed to do
